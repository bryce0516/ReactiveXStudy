#### The Observer pattern done right
ReactiveX is a combination of the best ideas from
the Observer pattern, the Iterator pattern, and functional programming

### CREATE
Easily create event streams or data streams.

### COMBINE
Compose and transform streams with query-like operators.

### LISTEN
Subscribe to any observable stream to perform side effects.


#### Ubiquitous
ReactiveX is everywhere, and it's meant for everything.

### FRONTEND
Manipulate UI events and API responses, on the Web with RxJS, or on mobile with Rx.NET and RxJava

### CROSS-PLATFORM
Available for idiomatic Java, Scala, C#, C++, Clojure, JavaScript, Python, Groovy, JRuby, and others

### BACKEND
Embrace ReactiveX's asynchronicity, enabling concurrency and implementation independence
